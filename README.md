# DynamicTable

Built using: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, PHP
This was an interesting experiment in expanding my coding skills.
Functionality includes:

    adding/removing table rows as needed
    pagination
    sort by column
    search table
    clear entire table with one click
    export table as: csv, PDF, Excel(csv)
    print or copy to clipboard
    file uploads

I wanted to make table that could be manipulated in the browser easily. While researching the project, I came accross an existing solution. That was Data Tables, a jQuery plug-in that could already handle most of the heavy lifting for me. Not seeing any reason to 'reinvent the wheel,' I went about implementing it into my own code. Which proved to be not as straight-forward as it sounds. I learned a lot about jQuery and some of its advanced functionaltity, though.

To implement file uploads, I used DropzoneJS to handle the front-end and php for the back-end. This was fairly easy an served as a great exercise in manipulating the file system with php.
