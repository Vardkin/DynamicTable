Dynamic Table  

Built using: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, php
This was an interesting experiment in expanding my coding skills. 

Functionality includes:
-adding/removing table rows as needed 
-pagination 
-sort by column 
-search table 
-clear entire table with one click 
-export table as: csv, PDF, Excel(csv) 
-print or copy to clipboard 
-file uploads 

I wanted to make table that could be manipulated in the browser easily. While researching the project, I came accross an existing solution. That was Data Tables, a jQuery plug-in that could already handle most of the heavy lifting for me. Not seeing any reason to 'reinvent the wheel,' I went about implementing it into my own code. Which proved to be not as straight-forward as it sounds. I learned a lot about jQuery and some of its advanced functionaltity, though. 

To implement file uploads, I used DropzoneJS to handle the front-end and php for the back-end. This was fairly easy an served as a great exercise in manipulating the file systm with php.
